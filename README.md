## Repository Structure
Each round has their own folder which contains each cateogory's folder and an editorial for the round.

Each problem has their own folder in respective rounds and categories. The folder name is the `slug` of the problem, which is the codename we used when we internally prepare the problems. The following image shows the structure of this repository.
